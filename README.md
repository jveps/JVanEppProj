# User-CustomerManagementSystem
An application that tracks customers and appointments.
Created in Java, uses the Model View Controller design pattern.
Connects to a SQL database where customers and appointments they've created are stored.

Not my most elegant work, but I learned a lot about issues that occur when you don't plan ahead!
